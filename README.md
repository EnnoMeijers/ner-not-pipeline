# ner-not-pipeline
NER and Network-of-Terms pipeline

Basic experiment for creating an NER pipeline in combination with querying the [NDE Netwerk of Terms](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/network-of-terms). NER code based on the Hands-On 1.2 code from the [Open HPI Knowledge Graph Course 2023](https://open.hpi.de/courses/knowledgegraphs2023).

It is recommended to use a virtual environment, create one using the following command:
```sh
$ python3 -m venv ./venv
```
Then activate the virtual evironment using:
```sh
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
This will result in a prompt starting with `(venv)`, the virtual environment is now activated.
